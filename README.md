# Word-Game

## About This Project
Wordplay is the word-game that tests your vocabulary not luck.

Players will guess randomly generated words with clues that are generated based on the Merriam-WebsterThesaurus API and API-ninjas random word API, including definitions, synonyms, and antonyms. Words are limited to words between 5-7 characters long, and with a sufficient thesaurus entry.The round ends when the word is correctly guessed or clues run out. 

The guessed words are stored in a word banks using local storage so players can always go back and see the words theyâ€™ve learnt. The score bar will show how many times the player has won and lost. 

### Prolbems needs to be solved:
